# What is it?

Droid Shooter is one of the turorial game from Unity known as **FPS Microgame**. But since its containing droid so i name it droid-shooter.

# Why is this game published here on GH?

Everyone's build is different. Unity gives you a barebone while you can build on it. This build on github are able to be pushed yourself (clone and use gh pages) and play on my build while i update regularly.
